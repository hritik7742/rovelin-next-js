Write a detailed, SEO-focused blog article in natural, human-sounding English.

Product:
{{product}}

Product Description (for context, do NOT repeat verbatim):
{{productDescription}}

Topic Style:
{{topic}}

Primary Keywords (weave these naturally into the article):
{{keywords}}

Previously used titles and topics for this product (DO NOT repeat or create close variants of these):
{{previousTitles}}

Requirements:
- 1500 words minimum (aim for 1500–2000 words)
- SEO optimized but natural (no keyword stuffing)
- Human readable English that feels like a good blog writer, not an AI
- No fluff, no generic filler sentences
- Practical, real-world content with concrete examples
- Clear structure with H1, H2, and H3 headings
- Include bullet points and numbered lists where helpful
- Include a short, compelling meta description (1–2 sentences)
- Include 4–8 relevant tags
- Include a short FAQ section (3–6 Q&A items) near the end
- Include 3–6 internal linking suggestions as a simple bullet list of suggested anchor texts and target URL paths (e.g. "/tools/image-extract", "/blog/how-to-record-demo-videos")
- Unique article: do NOT repeat any previous blog titles or topics for this product
- The angle of this article must be clearly different from the previously used titles/topics listed above
- When expressing comparisons (e.g. "< 20 minutes"), do NOT use raw "<" or ">" characters in normal text. Instead, write them out as words like "less than 20 minutes" or "greater than 20 minutes".

Output format:
- Return a single MDX document.
- Start with YAML frontmatter exactly like this (no extra text before or after frontmatter):
---
title: "<SEO optimized blog title>"
date: "{{date}}"
description: "<short meta description>"
tags: ["tag1","tag2","tag3"]
slug: "{{slug}}"
product: "{{product}}"
topicStyle: "{{topic}}"
---

Body format:
- After the frontmatter, include the full MDX content.
- Start with an H1 that matches the title.
- Use H2 and H3 headings to structure the article.
- Include a clearly labeled "FAQ" section near the end with H2/H3 headings.
- Include a clearly labeled "Internal Linking Suggestions" section with a bullet list of internal links.
- Do NOT include any code fences or JSON.
- Do NOT include any extra commentary or explanation.
- The entire response MUST be valid MDX only.
