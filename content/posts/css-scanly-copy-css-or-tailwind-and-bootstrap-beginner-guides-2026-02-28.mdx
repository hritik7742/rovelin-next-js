# How to Copy and Analyze CSS Styles Like a Pro with CSS Scanly for Tailwind & Bootstrap

Every developer who’s worked with CSS knows the challenge of reverse-engineering a website’s design. Whether you’re debugging a layout issue, replicating a button’s styles, or learning how a framework like Tailwind or Bootstrap structures its components, the process can be time-consuming and frustrating. That’s where [CSS Scanly - Copy CSS | Tailwind & Bootstrap](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ilklniobjoigkehieijcncgnoemlljmk) shines. This Chrome extension simplifies **style inspection**, lets you **copy CSS** with a single click, and identifies framework-specific classes—making it a must-have tool for front-end developers of all skill levels.

In this guide, we’ll walk through the core features of CSS Scanly and show you how to use it to streamline your workflow. From analyzing Bootstrap components to extracting Tailwind utility classes, you’ll learn how to save time and reduce guesswork when working with existing websites.

## Why Traditional CSS Inspection Falls Short

Before diving into CSS Scanly, let’s address why built-in browser dev tools might not always cut it:

- **Computed styles** are buried under layers of inherited rules.
- **Tailwind/Bootstrap classes** are not clearly labeled in the DOM inspector.
- **Copy-pasting styles** requires manual filtering to avoid irrelevant rules.
- **Testing changes** means editing live files or using temporary overrides.

CSS Scanly tackles these pain points head-on by providing a focused interface for developers who need to **analyze and reuse CSS styles** efficiently.

## Getting Started: Install and Activate CSS Scanly

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Install the extension** from the Chrome Web Store.
2. **Refresh any webpage** (e.g., Twitter, GitHub, or your own project).
3. **Activate scanning mode** by clicking the CSS Scanly icon in your browser toolbar.
4. **Hover over elements** to see their full CSS properties in real time.

> 🛠️ Pro tip: The extension works best on sites with clean CSS architecture, but it’s equally powerful on messy, legacy codebases.

## Core Features of CSS Scanly

### 1. **Real-Time Style Inspection**

When scanning mode is active, CSS Scanly overlays your screen with a visual map of all clickable elements. Hovering over any component (buttons, cards, headers) reveals:

- **Computed CSS values** (font size, colors, margins, etc.)
- **Applied classes** (including Tailwind or Bootstrap classes)
- **Priority rules** (which styles override others)
- **Inheritance chain** (helps debug unexpected layout behavior)

This feature eliminates the need to toggle between your browser’s dev tools and the webpage itself, saving you dozens of steps daily.

### 2. **One-Click CSS Copying**

Let’s say you want to recreate a specific button style from a Bootstrap site. With CSS Scanly:

1. Click the element to auto-copy its CSS.
2. Paste the code into your project.
3. (Optional) Filter the output to exclude non-essential rules like `transition` or `box-shadow`.

This is particularly handy when working with **frameworks** like Tailwind, where styles are split into multiple atomic classes.

### 3. **Framework Class Detection**

One of CSS Scanly’s standout capabilities is its ability to identify **Tailwind CSS** and **Bootstrap** classes. For example:

- **Tailwind**: Hovering over a utility-styled element might show `bg-blue-500 text-white p-4`.
- **Bootstrap**: You could see `btn btn-primary d-flex justify-content-center`.

This helps you understand how frameworks apply styles and speeds up prototyping. If you’re learning these tools, the class breakdown acts as an instant cheat sheet.

## Use Case: Reverse-Engineering a Design

Imagine you’re tasked with creating a clone of a popular website’s homepage. Here’s how CSS Scanly accelerates the process:

### Step 1: Scan the Layout
Enable scanning mode and hover over hero sections, navigation bars, and footer components. Note the spacing, typography, and color values.

### Step 2: Copy CSS for Specific Elements
Use the one-click copy feature to extract styles for the header navigation. For Bootstrap sites, you’ll see how `.navbar-expand-lg` and `.navbar-brand` classes work together.

### Step 3: Compare Multiple Elements
Pin style panels for two similar buttons side by side. This lets you spot differences in padding, font weight, or hover effects.

### Step 4: Test Edits Visually
Temporarily adjust a card’s `margin-bottom` value in the tool to see if it aligns better on mobile. The changes stay local to your browser session—no need to modify production code.

## Best Practices for Using CSS Scanly

- **Pin 2-3 style panels** at once to compare different sections of a layout.
- **Use the search bar** to find specific properties like `font-family` or `grid-gap`.
- **Save frequently used styles** in a notes app by copying snippets directly from the tool.
- **Test in incognito mode** to avoid conflicts with cached styles or browser extensions.

## How CSS Scanly Compares to DevTools

| Feature                  | CSS Scanly              | Browser DevTools        |
|--------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| Framework class detection | ✅ Tailwind/Bootstrap | ❌ Manual parsing required |
| One-click copy          | ✅ Full CSS snippet     | ⚠️ Requires filtering   |
| Multiple style panels    | ✅ Side-by-side view    | ✅ But harder to manage   |
| Temporary style editing  | ✅ Live preview support | ✅ Needs manual overrides |

While browser dev tools remain indispensable, CSS Scanly adds a layer of **contextual intelligence** that’s tailored to developers who copy and reuse styles often.

## FAQ: Your Questions Answered

### **Can I use CSS Scanly with my custom CSS?**
Yes! The tool works on any website, whether it uses vanilla CSS, a framework, or your own style sheets.

### **Does CSS Scanly modify the original webpage?**
No. All style edits are temporary and exist only in your browser session. The source website remains unchanged.

### **What if an element uses multiple CSS files?**
CSS Scanly displays **computed styles** that account for all applied rules, so you don’t have to track down which CSS file owns a specific property.

### **Is there a keyboard shortcut to activate scanning mode?**
Currently, you must click the extension icon, but the team is considering adding shortcuts in a future update.
